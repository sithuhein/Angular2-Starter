# Angular 2 Starter

The goal of this starter app is to provide
a simple way to get started with Angular 2 while also showing key Angular 2 features. The sample
relies on System.js to load ES6 modules.

Simply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started.

## Angular 2 Concepts Covered

* ES6 Version of the Application
* *TypeScript version coming soon*
* ES6 Module loading with System.js
* Defining routes and using router-outlet (router-link currently isn't working so only 1 view is shown for now)
* Building Custom Pipes
* Using Custom Components
* Using Custom Directives
* Defining Properties and Using Events in Components/Directives
* Using the Http object for Ajax calls
* Working with Utility classes (such as for sorting)
* Using the New Databinding Syntax [] and ()

## Usage

1. Install global dependencies **if necessary**

        npm install -g gulp-cli superstatic

2. Install node packages:

        npm install

3. Start the server

        ss

4. Open a browser and navigate to the site/port shown by Superstatic. The server runs the ES6 version of the application by default.
